            <h3>What is archive clothing?</h3>
            <p>At its most superficial, it’s owning an exceedingly rare piece of designer clothing to stunt in. <br>
                At its most obsessive, it means becoming an archivist of your favorite designer, researching, collecting <br>
                and reselling their rarest pieces out of sheer love and maybe a little bit of one-upmanship. Strictly <br>
                speaking, archival fashion is any piece of clothing taken  from a designer’s past body of work, but in <br>
                the last few years it has come to describe specific pieces from historically significant menswear collections.</p>

            <h3>What are the key's archival fashion brands?</h3>
            <p>In reality, what signals that a brand is a ‘key archival fashion brand’ is completely dependent on your tastes and <br>
             interests. While techwear ninjas may lust after Massimo Osti designed Stone Island or early Acronym pieces, ‘Lo Heads <br>
             are probably more interested in Polo Ralph Lauren Snow Beach. Though punk collectors search far and wide for Vivienne <br>
             Westwood’s ‘Seditionaries’ collection, forum members of StyleZeitgeist are more likely to drop serious dollars on Carol <br>
             Christian Poell or the pre-Nike legal action Rick Owens Geobaskets. Basically, each fashion tribe has its own key designers. </p>

            <h3>What are archive pieces?</h3>
            <p>While technically all vintage designer clothing could be considered an ‘archive piece’, the term has come to define <br>
             something more specific than just any piece from a designer’s archive.  Rather, an archive piece is usually one of a <br>
             designer’s ‘greatest hits’ from their back catalog, usually a particularly rare or sought after garment from one of their <br>
             seminal or career-defining collections.</p>
